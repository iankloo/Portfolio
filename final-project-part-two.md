# Wireframes / storyboards

I opted to create my wireframe/storyboard directly in Shorthand: https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/our-last-defense-against-a-global-pandemic-bird-hunters/index.html.  As it stands, I have the core visualizations, but I plan to add another few visualizations along with some call-out statistics before the final version.  I also need to sharpen the language to make sure the story flows correctly. These will all be changes made in Part 3 of the project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is upland bird hunters in Pennsylvania. I have some additional calls to action for bird farmers and policymakers, but these are mostly included to clarify that there needs to be an effort beyond what hunters can do to solve this problem.

I will interview three people: two will be hunters, and one will be a non-hunter with family members who hunt.  While the target audience is bird hunters, I want to include the third non-hunter as a proxy for someone new to hunting.  Ideally, this information would be provided to anyone with a Pennsylvania hunting license, and I want to ensure it is comprehensible to someone who doesn't have significant hunting experience.  

## Interview script

My interview questions will focus on first making sure that the main points I want to convey are actually coming across.  My Shorthand page is sort of a "minimum viable product" at this stage, meaning I have additional information that I could include if it would be helpful.  My goal for this first pass at Shorthand was to make sure that I was telling the core story and explaining those core points in their full context.  I am hoping the users "get it" so that I can move on and add more information.  If they are unable to answer these questions effectively, I need to refine things before moving on.  

Next, I will shift to some more open-ended questions that will identify any areas of confusion or places where people could benefit from added information or context.  This will help direct which specific pieces of new information I add to the project.    

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|Convey the magnitude of the risk posed by H5N1 to people.|How could H5N1 affect people?|
|Convey the magnitude of the risk posed by H5N1 to hunting.|How could H5N1 affect hunting?|
|Leave the user empowered to affect change.|What can you do as a hunter to mitigate the risks of H5N1?|
|Find out what is being conveyed most effectively.|What is the most memorable part of the presentation?|
|Catch any remaining confusion.|Is there anything you are confused about from the presentation?|
|Find out what could be added in the future.|What are your next questions about H5N1 and hunting?|


## Interview findings

Interview 1 was with a bird hunter with ~10 years of experience.  Male, early 60s.  

Interview 2 was with an avid hunter who focuses on deer with ~5 years of experience.  Male, 30s.

Interview 3 was with a non-hunter with a family full of hunters.  Female, 60s.


| Questions               | Interview 1 | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| How could H5N1 affect people?| Correctly identified risk of pandemic.  Focused on how H5N1 related to other viruses.  Mentioned remembering H5N1 from the 1990s.| |Correctly identified risk of pandemic.  Also mentioned the risk to the poultry industry which could cause food prices to rise (remembered from 1990s panic).|
| How could H5N1 affect hunting?|Correctly identified risk to bird population, focused on 100% fatality rate to farmed birds.|             |Correctly identified it would kill all farm-raised birds.  Thought the wild birds had some immunity because they are "out in the world."|
| What can you do as a hunter to mitigate the risks of H5N1?|Focused on not having birds in vehicle, transporting in disposable boxes, and using PPE.  The first two points were actually targeted at farmers in the presentation.|             |Focused on not traveling with live birds in car and need to report to game commission if found a diseased bird.  Asked how you could know if a bird was diseased if it was already dead.|
| What is the most memorable part of the presentation?|Knew about bird flu but didn't think about how it could affect hunting in PA.  Had recently traveled to Argentina to hunt birds and they are very concerned there.  He thought that it was only a problem in South America.|                                |             |The death rate bar chart showing the relative danger of H5N1.|
| Is there anything you are confused about from the presentation?|Chart with bird harvest did not make it clear that the 2023 data would be projected, he thought it was how many had been harvested so far.  Also, the maps didn't render on mobile well.|             |Confused how pandemic was averted in the 1990s and why we couldn't just do those same things to avert another one.  Also was distracted by the mention of cats being infected.  Not clear on what constitutes PPE.|
| What are your next questions about H5N1 and hunting?|What about turkey? More people hunt turkey in PA than upland birds, so probably want to mention them as well.|             |Wanted more specifics in the call to action and possibly some more information about the scale of upland bird hunting in PA (i.e., is this a big deal)?|

# Identified changes for Part III
1. Fix maps, probably need to rebuild these in something more responsive to mobile...flourish probably.
2. Fix bird visualization by making it clear this is a projection...maybe do this with animation?
3. Add to story that culling bird populations could affect poultry, cause problems with world hunger.
4. Clarify why wild birds are less susceptible to H5N1.
5. Add more to the call to action to clarify what hunters can/should do.
