# Wireframes / storyboards

I opted to create my wireframe/storyboard directly in Shorthand: https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/our-last-defense-against-a-global-pandemic-bird-hunters/index.html.  As it stands, I have the core visualizations, but I plan to add another visualization or two along with some call-out statistics.  I also need to sharpen the language to make sure the story flows correctly. These will all be changes made in Part 3 of the project.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is upland bird hunters in Pennsylvania. I have some additional calls to action for bird farmers and policy makers, but these are mostly included to make it clear that there needs to be an effort beyond what hunters can provide alone to solve this problem.
