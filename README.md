# About me
My name is Ian Kloo and I am a second year PhD student in the Societal Computing Program at Carnegie Mellon University.  I'm focusing my research on disinformation on Telegram, but am exploring broader social cybersecurity issues as well.  

I am a former Heinz student (MSPPM-POLA 2014) and am excited to get an opportunity to take a course back in the college.  After Heinz, I went into federal service and am currently serving as faculty in the Department of Systems Engineering at West Point.  After finishing my PhD studies, I will return to West Point where I am excited to apply the things that I learn in this course.

# What I hope to learn
I hope to learn how to make more unique and impactful visualizations for peer reviewed posters, conference presentations, and articles.  I've found myself falling into the same (boring) chart types as I write papers and I think I could start to set my work apart if I can get into some more interesting visualizations.  

I also hope to get some exposure to different tooling that is available for building charts.  I used old versions of Tableau and Plotly in the past and found them very limiting in that they seemed to only support the "basic" chart types.  It sounds like these tools have grown to support more unique chart types...or maybe I'll learn that isn't true and will be stuck trying to make interesting things with something like D3.  Either way, my knowledge on tools is out of date and I hope to update it.

Speaking of out of date knowledge, I have been a fairly strict adherent to the Tufte style since I was exposed to it during my masters work.  I am looking forward to exploring some newer/alternative design concepts instead of being stuck in a Tufte-designed prison. 

As mentioned above, I will return to my job teaching at West Point after I finish my studies at CMU.  While my time in federal service has given me access to some of the most interesting problems in the world, the ways that most of my peers approach visualization is "old school" (to put it nicely).  I'd like to take the things I learn in this class and apply them in the classroom so that the next generation of Army leaders starts with a modern approach to data visualization.
